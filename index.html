      <article><h1>Mindfulness</h1>
      <time datetime="2022-02-10">2022-02-10</time>
      <p>Yesterday I attended a promotional meetup in german for mindfulness. Usually the coaches there do an example exercise with the attendees. This is the second time it did such an exercise and it is the second time that I felt </p>
      <ul>
	      <li> more clear,</li>
	      <li> relaxed, </li>
	      <li> and more able to get concentrated</li>
      </ul> <p>afterwards.</p>
      <p>However, it was strange that the meeting was set for one hour, but lasted longer. This is strange for me, because the coach said he worked as a SCRUM master for several teams in his life. He worked also for google. However, for me a no go is some meeting that takes longer as expected without any descision of the group to do so. It is strange, that they delisted the meetup...sry, no link. </p>
      <p>So, enough about this meetup. Let us focus on mindfulness. Some thoughts:</p>
      <ol>
	      <li><a href"https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/mindfulness-at-work/">Google promotes this technique.</a></li>
	      <li>I wonder if this topic consists only of meditation plus "Get this thing done" - put it into the daily workflow.</li>
      </ol>

	<p>They told me, I get a T-Shirt and maybe some Burgers. Because the last two times were interesting, I like the idea of advertising this Meetup. You will find more information under <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Legacy-Innovation-Hamburg">https://www.meetup.com/Legacy-Innovation-Hamburg</a>. There are also Youtube links for recordings of recent Legacy and Innovation Meetups.

	<h1>Book reception: &quot;Getting Things Done&quot;, David Allen</h1>
	<time datetime="2020-08-16">2020-08-16</time>
	<p>This book is a must. I have never read before such a coherent text about how to organise things in life. Usually one gets tips from friends, colleagues and such to use this technique or that one they once used or are using. However, these tips always only focus on one part of organising tasks, life, work, ..., the technologies, ...., you get the point. David Allen wrote a very practical book with much experience. I felt throughout the text, that he had every sort of experience in GTD - be it clients, himself or other people in his life. </p>
	<h2>Has the author something to tell?</h2>
	<p>If it is only this from page 204: &quot;There are myriad ways to give up. You can ignore teh physical world and its realities and trust in the universe. I did that at one point, in my own particluar way, ant it was a powerful experience. And one I wouldn't wish on anyone. I tried to check out of my practical connections, though I didn't choose to end my life (but it was a close call!). I had much to learn about cooperating with the word I'd chosen to play in. but surrendering to your inner awareness, and its intelligence and advice for the worlds you live in, is the higher ground. Trusting yourself and the source of your intelligence is the most elegant version of experiencing freedom and manifesting personal productivity.&quot; </p>
	<h2>Is deeper knowledge hidden in the book?</h2>
	<p>Yes. The author has much experience in organising things as a consultant and from live experience.</p> 
	<h2>Does the book have a bibliography?</h2>
	<p>Not as an own chapter.</p>
	<h2>Does the book cite literature?</h2>
	<p>Yes. He uses footnotes for citations. However, it is nice to see how the layout and the text plays with citing quotes of famous people, literature, and using footnotes for personal notes.</p>

	<h1>Book reception: &quot;The ORGANIZED MIND&quot;, Daniel Levitin</h1>
	<time datetime="2020-08-16">2020-08-16</time>
	<p>After reading &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; this one is a must. Where David Allen falls short with scientific explanation or broader statistics, &quot;The ORGANIZED MIND&quot; fills the gaps. Plus one learns many things about our mind. The reader with phsycological background will surely find also some interesting details and examples.</p>
	<h2>Has the author something to tell?</h2>
	<p>Sure.<br>
	To cite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Levitin&oldid=969801535">Wikipedia</a>, Daniel Levitin is a "[...] cognitive psychologist, neuroscientist, writer, musician, and record producer." These are pretty many roles. I feel throughout the book that he has talked to many people, digs deep when trying to understand the human mind, and fights with very important people or to say people with higher ranks about the truth of good organizations where people can use their minds for the good. The book alternates between recent scientific understanding of the mind, examples, and good practices.</p>
	<h2>Is deeper knowledge hidden in the book?</h2>
	<p>Yes. He did his homework. There are statistics, numbers, and examples.<br>
	Just one example: I now know that I harmed my body and my mind for 20 years of my life with sleep deprivation.</p>
	<h2>Does the book have a bibliography?</h2>
	<p> Yes. The author calls it &quot;Notes&quot; section.</p>
	<h2>Does the book cite literature?</h2>
	<p>Somehow. The author does not mark the citations in the text. However, in the Notes section he goes through every chapter, citing sentences of the book with some explanation and the literature where he got the information from. This is not always as expected in a phD thesis, but more than good enough.</p>

	<h1>Why I did not sell my Fairphone 2, but bought a Fairphone 3</h1>
	<time datetime="2020-08-16">2020-08-16</time>
	<p>After my last post I talked to Fairphone sales, the service of my phone carrier, and bought the phone. Call quality and network is much better. But surely it is, because my phone carrier switched to 3G lately and surely worked on a better network.<br>
	With pleasure the sales contact of Fairphone did not want to sell me the Fairphone 3 with the promise that call quality would be better with the Fairphone 3. She rather told me to ask my phone carrier for reasons of bad network quality. This was a good idea, because the service of my phone carrier told me that they worked on towers nearby at that time. However, I was for a weekend away from home. This does not explain the outages in the city. <br>
	However, later I bought the phone. The thoughts nagged to long.<br>
	Then Vodafone changed to 3G mobile network. Then I saw that Fairphone works on upgrades to Android 9 on old Fairphone 2s.<br>
	Well, I am happy with the new phone due to longer battery time. I also do not have to wait for the upgrades.

	<h1>Repairs to come and why I will sell my Fairphone 2 to buy a Fairphone 3 </h1>
	<time datetime="2020-04-20">2020-04-20</time>
	<p>This post will deal with challenges I have making calls that lead me besides other reasons to buy a new phone. Recently I called several people that complained about bad voice quality. For one of them I had to wait on hold with my phone for one or two minutes only to get told that the other one cannot understand my voice and to hang up. One possible decision could be to change the bottom module for about 30 Euro (25 Euro for the module plus shipping.). However, I did this the a half year ago the last time. Because I need the phone to use for work, I hesitate to do this.</p>

	<h1>Fairphone: Repair front camera</h1>
	<time datetime="2020-03-07">2020-03-07</time>
	<p>Recently I wondered to buy a new Fairphone 3. My phone connection at home is sometimes not good. The internet connection on my way to work and even often in the big german city I live in is also weak using Vodafone network with 1&1. However, I know that this even happens with a iPhone 7. I remembered the criterium why I bought the Fairphone 2 in the first place: Longevity. Every time I get a new phone, there is some work to be done to set it up. A new phone costs at least 300 Euro if it should last about 2 years at minimum. This includes getting a phone with stable glas, a stable phone itself, and somehow some software updates. The new Fairphone 3 costs now about 450 Euro. A new Faiphone 2 top module with front camera costs 37.5 Euro if I buy directly from Fairphone Inc. . I decided to get the module to repair my phone. The phone is two years old. I paid about 540 Euro for the new phone. Now that are 270 Euro per year. This is too much investment into a device I use to do calls with and use as organizational device. Therefore I invest 10 % of the price in a replacement module. </p>
	<p>Now the front camera works again! After arrival of the package from Fairphone I followed <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Fairphone+2+Headphone+Module+Replacement/55049">this iFixit tutorial</a>.</p>
